## Why Dart? 
#### The Dart language is type safe; it uses static type checking to ensure that a variable’s value always matches the variable’s static type. Sometimes, this is referred to as sound typing. Although types are mandatory, type annotations are optional because of type inference. The Dart typing system is also flexible, allowing the use of a dynamic type combined with runtime checks, which can be useful during experimentation or for code that needs to be especially dynamic.

## Basics
Every dart program starts from with a main function for example:

```dart
void main() {
  //every thing inside this curly bracket will run
  print('Hello Kurdistan');
}
```
